# SecureX orchestration workflow repository

* SecureX orchestration provides a no-to-low code approach for building automated workflows. 
* These workflows can interact with various types of resources and systems, whether they’re from Cisco or a third-party. 
* This repository contains atomic actions and workflows that can be imported into SecureX orchestration as well as a variety of documentation.

## Atomic Actions
* Atomic actions are self-contained workflows that are similar to a function in traditional programming. 
* They can consume input, perform various actions, and then return output. 
* They’re designed to be portable, re-usable, and make building workflows more efficient.

## Workflows
* Workflows are the larger component of orchestration and are similar to a script in traditional programming. 
* A workflow can be simple and only have a few actions or be complex and string together many different actions for different products.

## Business Case

Service-oriented orchestration provides the agility to model and act on IT services. These features make creating orchestration active and dynamic, and allow for:

* Defining new, higher-level services in the system, and deploy new services quickly.
* In real-time, after these new types of services have been defined, creating real-time instances of those new services.
* Using events to watch for patterns in these services, enabling policy-driven automation.
* Service-oriented Orchestration combines several industry trends to synthesize a fresh approach to orchestration:
